Input
 - disk image
   - inode dedupe
   - resident files (batched)
   - compressed files
   - nonresident files (segmented w/ completion handlers; what did I mean by "segmented w/ completion handlers?"; oh maybe splitting up very large files?)
   - other attributes
   - slack
   - unallocated
 - directories
   - boost::filesystem
 - Merkle tree metadata records
 - multiple inputs (disk images, directories)
 - option to follow symbolic links? use of stat() vs lstat() for getting inode

Signatures
  - llara
    - define format, that simplifies yara
    - ensure grammar is LL
    - compose metadata filtering with content filtering
      - a normal yara rule only concerns itself with content -- THIS IS A GOOD THING
      - but practically, some situations demand metadata filtering, so allow creation of metadata rules and then mix them with content rules, e.g., cobalt_strike(only_system_files(x)) conceptually (not the syntax we should use) would filter all files by metadata to allow only "system files" and then those would be scanned with a cobalt strike rule
    - uses lightgrep patterns for strings, no distinction between fixed and regexp
    - has an encodings field for which encodings to use (default is ASCII? latin1?)
    - ship a yara -> llara conversion tool
  - STIX2
    - RapidJson, basic parse
    - artifact
    - file
    - IP
    - URL
    - Boolean eval
    - contains
    - match
  - YARA
    - grammar
    - parser
    - ...tbd...

Processing
 - Record states on FileRec; impossible vs possible vs identified
 - Metadata exclusion filter - reduce set of files as early as possible, disjunction of metadata rule terms
 - File signature analysis
 - Matcher
   - Size
   - Hash
   - Full path
 - Exclusion set on strand
 - Search
 - Signature evaluation
 - Signature match triggers second set of signatures? i.e., if {X}, then collect {Y}?
 - Recursive processing of compressed archives via libarchive

Output
 - record files by type? names and location...
 - buffering of record files
 - no tar, straight to filesystem option
 - temp dir for files in process

Plugins
 - manage subprocess lifetime
 - pass paths to subprocess
 - pump subprocess stdout and read paths for deletion
 - delete files

Optimization
 - TskAuto profiling & patches
 - Allocators or other pools for file records, batches, and search hits

Open Problems
 - Memory
   - not that hard
 - Event logs
 - Registry

Data Model
 - A file is...
   - one inode
   - multiple dirents
   - multiple attributes
 - Processing
   - Hash and Search Attribute data

Flow
 - Directory Walk
   - write inode record
   - if meta.nlink == 1, proceed; else, accumulate all dirents
   - 


The default attribute is the one where type matches the filesystem's default, with the lowest id
